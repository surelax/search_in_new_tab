### Description

This is a very simple Chrome extension, and what it does is only one thing:
Add a context menu to search your selected text in a new tab with Google.

### Background

Why make it? Doesn't Chrome already have this function?

Yes it does, and I have been using it for years.
However, recently Chrome adds a new context menu above the original context menu to search the text in a side panel.
I don't enjoy this function, and avoid using it because my screen isn't that big and I am more comfortable seeing the contents in the centre of the screen.

So these days when I try to search a selected text, I always have to pause and think for 200ms on which menu item to click.
This annoys me a lot, and i couldn't find a way to remove the additional context menu from Chrome.
So I decided to create this extension, I will simply train my brain to click on the extension context menu in future:)
